# Version 0.2
In this version, I just refactor the code to be more inline with OOP
I Split the code into diffrent class, to make it easier to work with

## Feature
there is no added feature in this code, only refactoring the code

## Issue to fix
Performance when paste the url, the app took so long to load the preview
I am trying to solve that issue, in the next update
### Idea to Try to Solve the Issue
- use Threading to handle the Preview part in diffrent thread so it doesnt interupt the UI
- Async/Await in python
- Implementing Caching using radis or sqlachemy ?


### Some Notes:
- Better Error Handling in the code
- Better if - else statement
